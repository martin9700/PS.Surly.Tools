#PS Surly Tools
Over the years I've written a LOT of scripts.  A LOT.  I thought it would be nice to publish some of the better ones--so many of my scripts are one off's that I can only publish a fraction of them--and put them all in one easy location.  Here they are.

#How this works
I've set up most of the functions in the Tools folder, where I've also compiled--compiled in the English dictionary sense, not the programming one!--them into a module.  I've also created my share of reports and put them in the Reports folder.  Those are standalone scripts, not functions.
